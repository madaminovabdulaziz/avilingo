## Subscription Cancellation vs. Refund

**Cancellation** and **refund** are different:

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Cancellation** | Your subscription stops renewing. You keep access until the end of your current billing period. No refund is issued. |
| **Refund** | Your payment is returned. Your access is typically revoked immediately. |

### To Cancel (Without Refund)
1. Go to Account Settings in the app
2. Select "Manage Subscription"
3. Click "Cancel Subscription"

Cancel at least 48 hours before your next billing date to avoid being charged.

---

## Chargebacks

We encourage you to contact us or Paddle for refund requests before initiating a chargeback with your bank.

Chargebacks:
- Take longer to resolve (30-90 days)
- May result in account suspension
- Should only be used for unauthorized transactions

---

## Free Trial

If you signed up for a free trial:
- No payment is charged during the trial period
- Cancel before the trial ends to avoid being charged
- If charged after trial, standard 14-day refund policy applies
